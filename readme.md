Jenkins Continuous Integration Project

This is my first Jenkins project for Continuous Integration (CI).
I used an AWS EC2 instance to set up both a Git server and a Jenkins server.
After connecting these two servers, I configured the workflow so that whenever I push code to GitHub, Jenkins automatically builds it.
